### About

MindGrind is a game jam submission to the [2nd Vaultacular Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/a-vaultacular-game-jam). The game has been created in two weeks with Unity 2021.1.

The repository also contains a test version of the MasterMind-like puzzle that is used in the macro-loop of the game, imaginatively called MasterThrind. The same licenses apply in the same configuration to that. MasterThrind is a C#/WinForms project, and Visual Studio 2019 was used in its development. Do note, this is a super-quick prototype to test out whether the intended macro-loop is feasible and whether extra features are needed to make the puzzle system working-game, and the quality reflects that.

For binary versions and for playing in-browser, see [MindGrind](https://zment.itch.io/MindGrind) on itch.io.
